    <p>This document describes the insights gained during the development of a demonstrator in the context of the Dutch governmental project "Doorontwikkeling in Samenhang" (Continued Development in Cohesion, DiSGeo), concerning the integration of the base registries. With this process, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations aims to achieve more coherence in the system of geospatial base registries, with a focus on semantic harmonization of registries and information models, and alternative methods of data exchange and updating (more central, less copying). The aim of this demonstrator was to test and show to a wide audience how geospatial data can be published in cohesion on the web.</p>

  <section id='sotd'>This is the final version of the Lessons Learned document published following the first phase of the DisGeo demonstrator. It is not an officially consulted standard, but a report written jointly by those involved in the demo. These individuals have all been named as editors or authors of this document.</section>
